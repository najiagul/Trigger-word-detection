# Trigger-word-detection
This is the last project of the deeplearning specialization from coursera.
# Sequence Models
In this project, I have constructed a speech dataset and implemented an algorithm for trigger word detection.
Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.
